# Unix-PnW-API
A bunch of unix shell scripts to request api data from pnw.


# How do I use this?

it's simple! head over to your command terminal (only works for unix systems currently) 

Locate the folder which you put the files, copy the folder address

and enter it inside the terminal using `cd address here`

After you've entered the directory, do `bash filename`

where you replace filename with the name of the api you want to access followed by .sh

For example: `bash alliance-members.sh`

You will be prompted for your api key, and then a request to the pnw website will be made fromo your pc
